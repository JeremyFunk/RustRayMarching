# RustRayMarching
Rusty Ray Marcher, implemented full animation support (almost every parameter of the entire ray marcher can be animated), post-processing, 12-Bit per channel rendering, sampling, Phong shading and much more. It is designed to be very easily extensible. Scenes and animations can be created in-code or using my real-time [Ray Marching Editor](https://github.com/JeremyFunk/RayMarchingEditor/blob/main/README.md)

Examples:

Signed distance functions and some of the modifiers are translated from the excellent [Inigo Quilez guides](https://iquilezles.org/). Phong Shading is loosely based on the [Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.php?redirect) implementation.
